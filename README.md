# Individual-Project-Proposal - Flight Price Tracker

## Project-Abstract
In this project proposal, I would like to implement a Flight Price Tracker bot that attempts to find the user a lower/similar price for a flight to the preferred destination. 
This project would allow users to interact with the bot, by providing the input of their starting and final destination along with the price range they wish to provide. 
Once a deal has been found, the user would be notified via their emails. The flight information would be found with the help of an API named FlightAPI.  

## Project Relevance
This proposal has relevance to the course materials as this project comes with the idea of TDD that would be done to ensure that the users are getting their information correctly.
There would also be a UML to provide a high-level representation of the idea to the developers. 
Since this bot would make sure that the users are being able to successfully provide information to the users, it would need an implementation of a GUI. 
Needless to say, there would be tools such as Debugging in order to ensure that the program is achieving all of its features effectively. 
If the project is considered as a group work, tools such as Version Control and Project Management would also be implemented. 

## Proposed Contribution
As this is a project from scratch, I would like to use Python/Java as a preferred programing language that will help me create a Graphical User Interface to help input and retrieve the data from the user. 
Once the data has been collected, the program would like to search for the price range and the final destination, accessing the API, using data structures to find and save information personal to each user, and informing the users about the same. 
I would also be following the idea of TDD to write tests to build trust and correct information to the users.

## Background
I think of this project as a sense of convinience to provide the users with a cheaper flights as this would be save real-life money and also save time instead of looking into other websites.

### Building 
- Pycharm to build in Python or NetBeans to build in Java
- Compatible with both MacOS and Windows.

### Running
- There would be a main to run the program through the GUI.
- Tests that can be run though the code editor.

## Resources Required
- Libraries for the Programming Language of choice
- Team Members (if this is opted for a group project)
